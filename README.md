# Simple Crosshair
A very simple crosshair overlay application made using Windows Forms C#. Does not show up in recordings/screen shares (optional).

I looked for a simple crosshair app but I was very disappointed to see they were either too robust or behind a paywall. This app is a very minimal and easy-to-use crosshair overlay. Enjoy!

## Instructions ##
1) Download the .exe and put it where you want it to stay. You will not be using it much. If you move it, your previously created shortcuts will be broken (you can edit them from property or just make them again).  
2) Open the app and click "Start Crosshair" to try different configurations.

3) Once you are happy with your configuration, click "Create Shortcut".

This will create a shortcut on your desktop with the parameters that you like.  
4) You can close the form now.

5) Open the shortcut on your desktop to use your crosshair.  
6) Done! When you want to close the crosshair, go to the tray and right-click -> exit.
